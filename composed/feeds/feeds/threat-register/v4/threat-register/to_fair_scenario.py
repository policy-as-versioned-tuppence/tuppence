"""to_fair_scenario.py — the threat register's own converter, shipped by its publisher.

Turns one institution's entry in this repository's signed threat-register payload
into a scenario JSON in the (min, mode, max) shape `platform/fair/fair.py`
consumes. Bumping the feed version is the whole diff needed to move the £; no
change to fair.py.

WHY IT LIVES HERE (eco-system ticket 79 item 4, ticket 24). It used to live in
`platform/feeds/to_fair_scenario.py`, in the SUBSCRIBER's repository, and it
carried `THREAT_LM_GBP` — a table keyed on the three adopters' names holding the
impact per loss event for each. So the platform held a signed-looking number
about each institution that no publisher had published, that no subscriber could
re-derive from anything signed, and that a fourth adopter could not have obtained
at all. From payload major 3 the number is in the payload (`institutions.<name>.
lm_gbp`, with `lm_basis`) and the code that reads it is here, beside it.

STANDALONE, ON PURPOSE. This module imports nothing but the standard library and
reads nothing but the payload path it is given. `platform/compose/composition.py`
vendors it into each adopter's `composed/feeds/feeds/<version>/` with a
`PROVENANCE.json` recording the exact argv and the sha256 of the scenario it
returned (eco-system ticket 45), and the hub's `verify/portability/` REPLAYS that
argv in a directory holding nothing but this file and the payload. A sibling
import, a relative path or a read of anything outside the payload would break
that replay, which is the point of it.

PRE-MAJOR-3 PAYLOADS. Majors 1 and 2 are published and carry no `lm_gbp`. They
still price, at the same magnitudes, from FROZEN_LM_GBP below — and the scenario
says so by name: a NAMED could-not-look, never a bare number. That table is
frozen: it is the bytes that were in the platform when the move happened, and it
gains no entry ever. A fourth institution on a pre-major-3 payload refuses,
because there is nothing about it to be frozen.
