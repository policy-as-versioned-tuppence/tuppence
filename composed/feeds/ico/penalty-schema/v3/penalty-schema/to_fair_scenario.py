"""to_fair_scenario.py — turn an ico penalty-schema entry into a fair.py scenario.

Reads the ico penalty schema (regime -> violation-type -> fine formula/cap + real
public examples) and emits a scenario JSON in the same (min,mode,max) shape
`platform/fair/fair.py` already consumes (see estate/platform/fair/scenarios/
driftwood-cart-pii.json) — so bumping the schema version is the whole diff needed
to move the £ fair.py reports; no change to fair.py itself.

Loss-magnitude (lm) triple per formula type:
  - pct_of_global_turnover / pct_of_relevant_revenue_plus_discretion:
      min = smallest real example, mode = median of real examples, max = cap
      (or, absent a cap, 1.2x the largest example -- FCA has no statutory cap).
  - per_violation_tier (HIPAA): min/max straight from the statutory tier,
      mode = median of real examples clipped into [min, max].
  - per_month_escalating (PCI): steady-state (7+ months) monthly band annualised
      by the ponytail LEF below, mode = midpoint of that band.

Loss-event-frequency (lef) is NOT in the schema -- the schema prices "when it
lands", not "how often". ponytail: a flat editorial per-regime warn-LEF, tune per
institution if a scenario needs it; deny collapses LEF the same way every other
scenario in this estate does (deny.lef ~ (0,0,1)).

One breach can draw more than one regime's consequence (an ICO fine *and* a PCI
penalty on the same incident, say) -- pass `--also REGIME:VIOLATION_TYPE`
(repeatable) to `build` to fold further obligation sources into the same
scenario's lm. fair.py prices them additively and correlated, never as separate
risks (ticket 18). Which regimes actually apply to which workload stays an
open, separate gap (ticket 17) -- this only combines regimes named explicitly.
