"""reach.py — the posture gate as pure, offline-testable logic (ticket 17).

Both surfaces of this ticket gate on the SAME thing: does a caller's SVID *path*
carry the current-posture prefix?
  * Istio AuthorizationPolicy matches `source.principals` (authorizationpolicy.yaml)
  * OpenBao jwt role globs `bound_claims["sub"]` (openbao-role.yaml)

Both are `spiffe://…/posture/<vN>/*` globs. The demonstrable claim — "a current
caller reaches + gets the secret; an out-of-currency caller is refused BOTH" —
reduces to a glob match, which is checkable without a cluster. We parse the glob
straight out of the two real manifests (not a copy) so the test guards the
shipped artifacts, and assert:
  1. a current SVID matches BOTH globs (reach AND secret),
  2. a stale SVID and a de-postured base SVID match NEITHER (lose both),
  3. the two globs pin the SAME version (reach and secret can't drift apart).

    reach.py selfcheck     # runnable asserts, no cluster
    reach.py globs         # print the two parsed globs
